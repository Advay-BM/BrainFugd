# BrainFugd
The python programs you will find here are my attempt at completely recreating another programming language Brainf*** in python.

Brainf*** is a an actual Turing complete programming language with just 8 usable chracters(+ - < > [  ]  ,  .) that was probably made as a joke. Why did I spend multiple weeks recreating a completely useless programming language in python?
My answer: Yes.

 ## Brainfugd.py
 WIP. This will give you a pure Brainfugd experience which mean you cannot see the status of your cells only the output.
 ## Brainfugd+.py
 Recommended for newcomers. Includes a tutorial on how to use Brainfugd as well as some challenges. You have 6 cells and the Brainfugd interpreter is basically the same as the original language except with a few twists of my own.



 This is my first github project and probably my biggest python project so the code is really basic. If you are more experienced than I am, you are welcome to suggest changes as well as ideas. I don't know why anyone would waste their time doing that or even using my code but this was more like a personal challenge to see what I can do.
